- 👋 Hi, I’m @thomas2mars aka Thomas.
- 👀 I’m interested in the world of Machine Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently a 2nd year engineer student at INSA Centre Val de Loire in Bourges. I'm in a security and computer technology course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all types of Machine Learning projects. But I'm more at ease with Deep Learning and Neuron Networks.
